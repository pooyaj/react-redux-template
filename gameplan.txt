Webpack: 
1- Add webpack and webpack dev server
    (might want to do a global install to bring them in path)
2- Create the "webpack.config.js" file
>> Now should be able to run webpack-dev-server to start server

Babel: 
1- Install babel es2015 and jsx modules
2- update the package.json and webpack.config.js to use babel
